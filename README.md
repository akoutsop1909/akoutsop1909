### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
Welcome to my GitHub profile. Here you'll find academic work and research I completed during my BSc and MSc studies in Informatics Engineering, as well as personal projects I've developed in my free time. My focus areas include back-end development, data science, and machine learning. 

Feel free to explore the selected pinned repositories below or browse through all of them via the "Repositories" tab above (BSc and MSc thesis code also available).
